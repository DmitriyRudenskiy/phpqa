* object has lot of public methods  (9, excluding getters and setters)
* object has a high Lack of cohesion of methods (LCOM=8)
* object knows everything (and use lot of external classes)

Maybe you should reducing the number of methods splitting this object in many sub objects.</violation>

* Algorithms are complex (Max cyclomatic complexity of class methods is 8)

Maybe you should delegate some code to other objects or split complex method.</violation>
